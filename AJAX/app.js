// AJAX is not a language. 
// data recieved from server in form on JSON ==> JavaScript Objeect Notation
// Some sites send in the form of XML

// XML is used for recieving data from server although any format including plian text can be used

/* 
    Ajax uses XHTML for content, CSS for presentation along with document object model and JavaScript for dynamic content display.

    It is a web browser technology independent of web server software.
*/

// Where there is a need for real time data AJAX is used.
// API ==> Application Programming Interface

// API Brings partial data from the server to the client.

// AJAX is based upon open standards: 
/*
    1. Data fetch through XMLHttpRequest objects.
    2. Always use Async Mode for data transfer.
*/

// AJAX can't Work alone. It uses JavaScript and DOM requests.
